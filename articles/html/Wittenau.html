  <b>Wittenau</b>, officially <b>Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm)</b> is a
  railway station in the Wittenau district of Berlin, Germany. It is served by
  the Berlin S-Bahn and numerous local buses. It is also the northern terminus
  of the Berlin U-Bahn line <b>U8</b>.

<h2>U-Bahn Station</h2>

  Since the construction of the Märkisches Viertel in the 1960s, a connection
  to the U-Bahn had been planned. In the mid-1980s, an extension of line U8 was
  decided. This extension was to branch off toward Wittenau and cross the
  Märkisches Viertel from the west. However, it wasn’t until September 24, 1994,
  that today’s terminus station Wittenau on the U8 was opened at the Wittenau
  S-Bahn station, and it was handed over for operation on September 29.

  The U-Bahn station was designed by architect Rainer G. Rümmler. In line with
  other U-Bahn stations built in Berlin during the 1980s, it features colorful
  tiles—primarily in green and yellow here. The patterns on the columns are
  reminiscent of trees supporting the ceiling. The station lies beneath
  Wilhelmsruher Damm and includes a connection to the S-Bahn.

  An extension of the U8 eastward into the Märkisches Viertel is planned, but due
  to Berlin’s tight budget situation, it remains unlikely for the foreseeable
  future.
