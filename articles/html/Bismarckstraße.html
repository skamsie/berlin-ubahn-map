<h2><span id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>At the time when the first U-Bahn line (<i>Stammstrecke</i>) opened in 1902, the road was laid out in a lavish boulevard style as the western continuation of Charlottenburger Chaussee (today: Straße des 17. Juni) and part of a direct connection between the Berlin city centre at Brandenburg Gate to the western suburbs of Charlottenburg and Spandau along Kaiserdamm and Heerstraße. On 14 December 1902, <i>Knie</i> station opened at present-day Ernst-Reuter-Platz; the western extension to <i>Bismarckstraße</i> station (today: Deutsche Oper) and the <i>Wilhelmplatz</i> (today: Richard-Wagner-Platz) terminus near Charlottenburg Town Hall was inaugurated on 14 May 1906.
</p><p>On 29 March 1908, the western continuation of the present-day U2 line to <i>Reichskanzlerplatz</i> (today: Theodor-Heuss-Platz) in Westend was opened. It branched off at <i>Bismarckstraße</i>, which remained the original name of present-day Deutsche Oper station until 1929. Today's Bismarckstraße station, located about 380 m (1,250 ft) to the west, was not built along the U2 until the 1970s, when the construction of the new U7 line from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz (former <i>Wilhelmplatz</i>) required a two-level station at the intersection.
</p><p>The old tunnel at the site was completely rebuilt as a reinforced concrete construction, with the new U7 tunnel running under it in north-south direction. The station was opened with the new U7 section on 28 April 1978.
</p><p>Bismarckstraße station is currently undergoing an overall refurbishment.
