  The station was built from 1898 to 1901. The planned name was Görlitzer Bahnhof, and Oranien-Wiener-Straße was also considered. It was opened at the same time as the first section of the elevated and underground railway, but on February 18, 1902 under the name Oranienstrasse.

  The concept of the station was designed by the office of <i>Siemens & Halske AG</i>. Since February 14, 1926, the station was called Görlitzer Bahnhof (Oranienstraße) after the nearby head station. The name was changed at the request of the passengers. In 1982 the name extension Oranienstrasse was officially deleted, but stuck to every second station sign.
