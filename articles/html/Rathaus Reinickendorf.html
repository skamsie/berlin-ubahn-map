  The <b>Rathaus Reinickendorf</b> U-Bahn station is a stop on Berlin's U8 line and
  was opened on September 29, 1994, as part of the northern extension of the U8
  to Wittenau.

  The station, designated as RR in the BVG station directory, is equipped with
  both stairs and escalators, as well as an elevator, making it fully accessible.
  The station is 1,207 meters from Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik station and 1,101
  meters from Wittenau station. The namesake Reinickendorf Town Hall is located
  to the west, directly opposite the northern entrance on Eichborndamm.

  The central platform of the station has exits at both ends, each leading to
  entrance halls. The southern exit is a special feature: it has an above-ground
  entrance hall that spans the Nordgraben like a bridge. Red bricks adorn the
  walls of the platform hall, complemented by natural stone blocks that add
  variety. The central support columns are red, white, and black, with yellow
  capitals. Like the other stations on the U8 line that opened in 1994, this
  station was designed by Rainer G. RÃ¼mmler.
