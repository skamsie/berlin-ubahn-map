  The development of the area around the present Adenauerplatz was planned in 1913. The Kurfuerstendamm line (later U3, today U1) was to cross further westwards from the Uhlandstrasse station, the present-day terminus, and terminate at Theodor-Heuss-Platz station. These plans were not initially put into action, meaning that the station was not built until the U7 line was extended in the 1970s. To accommodate the western extension of the U3, which was still in the planning stage, a second platform was built underneath the U7.

Ruemmler originally designed the station, however during the renovation many of the station's original features were removed.

  In 2016, it was proposed to construct an elevator to make the station accesible to persons with disabilities. Construction started in 2018, and it was put into operation on 1 February 2019.
