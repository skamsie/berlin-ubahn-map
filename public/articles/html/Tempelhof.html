  The U-Bahn station opened on 22 December 1929 under Tempelhofer Damm where
  the South Ring crossed it, and was thus called Tempelhof (SÃ¼dring). It was
  designed by Alfred Grenander in an unusually spare style with open mezzanine
  galleries at both ends of the platform. The exit at the north end leads
  directly into the S-Bahn station building, which was an innovation at the
  time. Until 1966 it was the southern terminus of the CII line, now the U6; the
  tunnel to Alt-Tempelhof was almost completely excavated when work was
  suspended in 1941 because of World War II.
