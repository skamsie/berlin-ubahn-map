<p>The U-Bahn, or <i>Untergrundbahn</i> (underground railway), was a major revolution in Berlin's public transport, and the forerunner of similar systems now seen in several German cities. The underground sections alternated with sections elevated above ground on viaducts – hence the alternative name <i>Hochbahn</i> (literally "high railway"). The first line (now part of line U1) ran from Stralauer Tor to Potsdamer Platz.  Begun on 10 September 1896 and opened on 18 February 1902, the actual Potsdamer Platz station was rather poorly sited. Though it was reached via an entrance right outside the main-line terminus, people then had to walk about 200 metres (660 ft) along an underground passage beneath the appropriately named Bahnstraße (Railway Street). It was built by a Swedish architect Grenander in 1902, and it was supposed to be named Potsdamer Bahnhof, or Potsdamer Ringbahnhof. But after 5 years the station was relocated just 180m to the southwest at Leipziger Platz.
</p><p>Later that year, the system was developed into a through line running from Warschauer Brücke to Knie, which actually placed Potsdamer Platz on a branch accessed via a triangle of lines (<i>Gleisdreieck</i>) between Möckernbrücke and Bülowstraße stations near the current Gleisdreieck station. The first Potsdamer Platz U-Bahn station saw use for just over five and a half years, until its inconvenient site, and the desire to reach other parts of the city, enabled it to be superseded by a better sited new station on an extension of the line to Spittelmarkt. The new station opened first, on 29 September 1907, and the rest of the extension to Spittelmarkt on 1 October 1908 (evidence of the original station's site can still be seen in the tunnel, from passing trains). As the new station lay mostly beneath the adjoining Leipziger Platz, this is what the station was initially called, renamed Potsdamer Platz on 29 January 1923.
</p><p>The station was one of a number designed by the Swedish architect Alfred Frederik Elias Grenander (1863–1931). From a technical point of view, its construction was something of a challenge, as above ground the Hotel Furstenhof was being rebuilt at the same time. The U-Bahn line extension and new station ran right through the hotel's basement, cutting it in half. Contrary to several sources, the hotel did not however enjoy a separate entrance directly from the station. The enormous Wertheim Department Store in nearby Leipziger Straße did enjoy such an entrance, as in later years did the Hotel Excelsior from the Anhalter Bahnhof.
</p><p>Until 1923 the station was known as Leipziger Platz. From then the name was Potsdamer Platz.</p><p>The station was closed from 13 August 1961 to 13 November 1993 when Berlin was separated by Berlin Wall. A border fortification was placed near to Potsdamer Platz station. This border fortification was removed in December 1990. It was imagined that trains on either side would simply run as far as the last stop before the border and then reverse back.  This was partly the case with the U-Bahn line through Potsdamer Platz, as the Mohrenstraße in October 1991, operationally became a terminus for trains on the eastern side.  On the western side however, the entire section all the way back to Wittenbergplatz was closed completely and at least partially dismantled.  Indeed, two of the abandoned stations on this section, Bülowstraße and Nollendorfplatz, were converted into markets.  The antiques market at the latter was housed in sixteen old wooden coaches lined up beside the platforms, while another coach even carried passengers back and forth to Bülowstraße where a Turkish bazaar was sited.
</p><p>This station was intended to be an interchange with the future driverless line U3 and U10, however the plans were scrapped when the U3 is primarily used since December 2004. It was partially converted into the event space for events and exhibitions since 2006.
