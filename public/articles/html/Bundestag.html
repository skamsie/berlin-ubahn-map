  Even though construction was completed in 1994, it took over a decade until
  the subway line U55 went into service in August 2009. In the intervening
  period, the partially completed station with its high ceiling and unusual
  architecture served as a location for cultural events like performances of
  the opera <i>The Magic Flute</i> and saw use as a film set for the
  <i>Resident Evil</i> film series, for <i>Ã†on Flux</i> and for
  <i>Equilibrium</i>.

  From 2009 to early 2020, only the eastern face of the island platform was
  used for a shuttle service between Hauptbahnhof and Brandenburger Tor. On 4
  December 2020 the extended line U5 opened and from this date trains on both
  platforms faces were served by trains.
