  From August 13, 1961, this station was a "ghost station". The BVG trains passed through the station in East Berlin without stopping. On December 22, 1989, this subway station was the second to be put back into operation after the Jannowitzbr√ºcke subway station in order to better absorb the rush of GDR citizens in the western part of Berlin. This station was selected because of its good tram connection and was equipped with a border crossing point until the currency union on July 1, 1990.
