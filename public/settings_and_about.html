      <h3>the project</h3>
      <p>
        This website is an interactive representation of the Berlin U-Bahn
        system inspired by
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skamsie/berlin-subway/master/U-Bahn_Berlin.png">this map</a>
        from 2016, but updated to the 2020 namings and routes. The most notable
        difference is that the Eastern terminus of U3 is now at Warschauer Straße.
        A couple of stations are also called differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The map is movable by dragging and scalable by zooming. Clicking on a
        station or its label brings up an image and information about the
        station. The information is taken from the English or German Wikipedia
        page. At the bottom of each article there is a link to the source.
        Since the pages are cached, the information might not be in sync with
        the corresponding Wikipedia article.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sidebar that displays the station information is resizable by
        dragging horizontally, but only on desktop. Once the sidebar is open,
        the 'previous' and 'next' links (or the ← and → keys on the keyboard)
        can be used for moving between stations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In april 2025 I also added a 'route finder' functionality (not
        available on small screens). The alghoritm was written in Prolog and is
        available <a href="https://github.com/skamsie/berlin-subway">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>For the implementation details, you can check out the project on
        <a href="https://github.com/skamsie/berlin-ubahn-map">Github</a>.

      <h3>the photos</h3>
      <p>
        In the begging of the project I was only using the default thumbnails
        returned by the Wikipedia API. Some of the photos are old and do not
        reflect the current condition or design of the stations (plus I became
        more and more interested in the U-Bahn due to its rich history),
        hence I decided to go photograph them myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In April 2020 I have photographed 168 out of the 173 stations with an
        iPhone X. For the rest of the stations, the images are taken from
        Wikimedia Commons and are licensed under the Creative Commons
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en">Attribution-Share
        Alike 2.0 Generic</a> license (unless stated otherwise).

      <h3>the u-bahn</h3>

      <p>
        The Berlin U-Bahn ([uː.baːn]; short for Untergrundbahn, "underground
        railway") is a rapid transit railway in Berlin, the capital city of
        Germany, and a major part of the city's public transport system.
        Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a
        tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city,
        it serves as the main means of transport in the capital.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opened in 1902, the U-Bahn serves 173 stations spread across ten lines,
        with a total track length of 151.7 kilometres (94.3 mi), about 80% of
        which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak
        hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes
        in the evening. Over the course of a year, U-Bahn trains travel 132
        million km (82.0 million mi), and carry over 400 million passengers. In
        2017, 553.1 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The entire system is
        maintained and operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, commonly
        known as the BVG.
